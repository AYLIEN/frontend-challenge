# Frontend Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your knowledge in the domain of front-end development. We expect you to build an Entities search application with JavaScript frameworks and libraries using AYLIEN News API. Besides, we would like you to write some tests. We are looking for a readable, easy-to-understand code that follows best practices and design patterns.

## The challenge
We need you to develop a Client (UI) architecture that allows users to search among entities and see related stories at the bottom of the search bar.

### Terminology
- An entity is a thing with a distinct and independent existence.
- A story contains information about a news article enriched with NLP metadata.

### Description
For this project, you will provide a search bar that allows users to search via entities using the `/autocomplete` endpoint and display related stories using the `/stories` endpoint.

We :heart: React and we already created a boilerplate project using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). However, you are free to use any frameworks and libraries you choose. The prototype is just a suggestion — you have complete creative freedom!

## Notes
Before starting the challenge, we would also like you to identify the required steps and provide a time estimate for these and share with us by email. If you can split these tasks into smaller items, please also share these. It’s up to you how much time you invest, but keep in mind that we expect a meaningful contribution and also that it should be possible to review your solution in a reasonable amount of time, so please provide instructions on how to get up and running with your solution and test it. Your solution is expected as a zip file, but please also include your .git directory — we are interested in your development steps, not just the end result.

We forged this exercise with great care and enthusiasm. Even if you decide not to submit your solution, we would appreciate your feedback. What was the most enjoyable part? What was unreasonably annoying? Let us know so that we can improve.
