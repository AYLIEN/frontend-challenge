# Frontend Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your knowledge in the domain of front-end development. We need you to build a Single Page Application with JavaScript frameworks and libraries and, if you deem necessary, data stream libraries of your choice. In addition, we would like you to write some tests. We are looking for a readable, easy to understand code that follows best practices and design patterns.

## The challenge
We need you to develop a Client(UI) and Server architecture which will allow the user to browse the JSON files inside the server folder.
 
 
## Terminology
- A Story contains information about a news article enriched with NLP metadata
- Clusters are collections of related stories which share common details
- Each cluster has a single representative story to showcase the types of stories it contains
**For this test, you will need to provide a way to list the clusters and then display representative stories for each cluster.**

For the client, we :heart: React and created a boilerplate project using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) However you are free to use any frameworks and libraries you choose. The prototype is just a suggestion, you have complete creative freedom!

For Server, We only provided the datasets in JSON format, you are free in your choice of Languages, frameworks and libraries.

We would like you to identify tasks that are required, provide a time estimation for all of these tasks before you start working on them. If you can split these tasks into smaller items, also share those, please. Itâ€™s up to you how much time you invest, but keep in mind that we expect some meaningful contribution and also that it should be possible to review your solution in a reasonable amount of time, so please provide instructions on how to get up and running with your solution and test it. Your solution is expected as a zip file, but please include your .git directory, we are interested in the steps of your development, not just the end result.

We forged this exercise with great care and enthusiasm. Even if you decide not to submit your solution, we appreciate your feedback. What was the most enjoyable? What was unreasonably annoying? Let us know, so we can improve.
