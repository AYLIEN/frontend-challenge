# Frontend Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your knowledge in the domain of front-end development. We need you to build a Single Page Application with JavaScript frameworks and libraries and, if you deem necessary, data stream libraries of your choice. In addition, we would like you to write some tests. We are looking for a readable, easy to understand code that follows best practices and design patterns.

## The challenge
We need you to develop a real-time News Explorer. Clusters are groups of related stories (news articles) which you can receive from the News API. You should represent a cluster list and update it when new clusters are available or there is any change to previously loaded clusters. It would be great if you could provide at least one type of filter or search as well. You should use the [News API](https://docs.aylien.com/newsapi/endpoints/#clusters) to access the clusters. You can sign up for a trial account [here](https://newsapi.aylien.com/) and use your credentials for this.

The endpoints you will be working with are the `/clusters` endpoint and `/stories` (optional).

Create a project to present components with the style you want. The prototype is just a suggestion, have the freedom to use your creativity at will! You are free in your choice of frameworks and libraries, but we :heart: React.

We would like you to identify tasks that are required, provide a time estimation for all of these tasks before you start working on them. If you can split these tasks into smaller items, also share those, please. Itâ€™s up to you how much time you invest, but keep in mind that we expect some meaningful contribution and also that it should be possible to review your solution in a reasonable amount of time, so please provide instructions on how to get up and running with your solution and test it. Your solution is expected as a zip file, but please include your .git directory, we are interested in the steps of your development, not just the end result.

We forged this exercise with great care and enthusiasm. Even if you decide not to submit your solution, we appreciate your feedback. What was the most enjoyable? What was unreasonably annoying? Let us know, so we can improve.
