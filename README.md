# Frontend Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your domain in front end development. This is a test for all levels, so we don't expect you to complete 100% or use all of the above front end concepts. We want to know about your knowledge and how you develop.

We hope you will build a SPA with Frameworks, JavaScript libraries and, if you deem it necessary, data stream architectures of your choice. In addition, we would like you to write test.

We want to see readability and its code design, good development practices, JavaScript Design Patterns used and their entire work process. You are free to create, commit and organize your project.

## The challenge
You should develop a real-time Cluster browser. Cluster is a groups of related stories. You should repesent a cluster list and update the list if new cluster are available. it would be great if provide at least four filters for clusters. You should use [News API endpoint](https://docs.aylien.com/newsapi/endpoints/#clusters) for this project.

Create a project to present components with the style you want. The prototype is just a suggestion, have the freedom to use your creativity at will!

The form of componentization is free and you can prioritize parts that best demonstrate your front end knowledge. Automated testing, project documentation and components are differential. Document everything you deem necessary, including the motivations of the different libraries and frameworks used.
